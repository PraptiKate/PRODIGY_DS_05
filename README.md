# Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization

## Objective
In this task, I analyzed traffic accident data to identify key patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualized accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: US Accident Data
- **Link**: [US Accident Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed the dataset to address missing values and ensure data consistency.
2. **EDA**: Explored accident patterns based on weather, road conditions, and time of day.
3. **Visualization**: Used heatmaps and geospatial visualizations to show accident hotspots.

## Key Insights
- Accidents were most frequent during **rainy** and **foggy** weather.
- **Afternoon** and **evening** had higher accident rates.
- **Poor road conditions** were linked to higher accident severity.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Geopandas

## Files
- **Traffic_Accident_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Conclusion
This task showcased my ability to work with geospatial data and extract actionable insights for traffic safety. The visualizations highlight critical patterns for road safety improvement.
